## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it uses the [29k Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as a compass towards a great experience in our co-creation process. By contributing, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [help@29k.org](mailto:help@29k.org).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 🧙, reproduce the behavior 💻 🧭, and find related reports 🔎.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue that facilitates identifiying what the bug is.
- Describe the steps to reproduce the bug in as many details as possible.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Screenshots and animated GIFs are super welcomed and appreciated.
- And ask questions, we love reflecting on things together and learning new perspectives!

When creating an issue through github you can choose "bug report" which will use the existing [template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us get into a common ground to co-create and know each other.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same or related to what you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Writing the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed is a great way for you to reflect on your suggestion and for us to get a clear understanding of what you're suggesting.

When you suggest an enhancement, please include as many details as possible:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue that facilitates identifiying what the enhancement is.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful for you and possibly for other users.
- If there are other apps that do the same feel free to list them as examples/inspiration, screenshots, gifs are welcomed!
- And ask questions, we love reflecting on things together and learning new perspectives!

When creating an issue through github you can choose "Feature request" which will use the existing [template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), the information it asks for helps us get into a common ground to co-create and know each other.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should need a bit more involvement than `beginner` issues.

Either type of issues you get involved in, it is with great joy that get this oppotunity to get to know you and co-create with you!

### Pull Requests

If your PR is related to an issue, add a link to the issue on its description.

Our [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md) will offer some guidance on basic info that should be added to your PR.

## Styleguides
