    "description": "Personal resources are internal, external, or imagined things, unique to each person, that bring about a sense of well-being, safety, or happiness when brought to present moment awareness. When we think of a personal resource (a wonderful memory, a favourite place, a loved one, a joyful activity, a comforting thought), this often brings about pleasant sensations in the body. If we then consciously attend to those sensations and give them space and time, they can deepen. This increases our nervous system’s sense of safety and brings about a greater sense of well-being and relaxation in the body."
